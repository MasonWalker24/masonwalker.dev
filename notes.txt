1. make a variable that is only the domain of url, not the path. then 
make a regex that replaces ./ with 
"http://localhost/proxy?url=" + domain + "/";

2. make a variable that removes the value after the last /, so 
squid.gq/games/lighplay.html, would become squid.gq/games. then make a 
regex that replaces a blank prefix with "http://localhost/proxy?url=" + 
domain2 + /. but only if the " isn't followed by http.
